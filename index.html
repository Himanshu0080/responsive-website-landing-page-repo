         <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
            and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as
            public schools. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal
            schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal
            and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary
            education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods,

         <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">he precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements
            about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering
            critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of
            education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms,
            equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates
            economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant
            role in education. For instance, governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school
            classes.</p>

         <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Many factors influence the success of education. Psychological factors
            include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity,
            and gender, are often associated with discrimination. Other factors encompass access to educational
            technology, teacher quality, and parental involvement.

            The primary academic field examining education is known as education studies. It delves into the nature of
            education, its objectives, impacts, and methods for enhancement. Education studies encompasses various
            subfields, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. Additionally, it
            explores topics such as comparative education, pedagogy, and the history of education.</p>
